# Windows 10 As It Should Be
This user guide will show you how to create a customized Windows 10 installation medium.

The goal of this project is to have a stripped-down version of Windows 10 that can be installed on any hardware. The finalized image should have a clean start menu with no tiles, be free of any superfluous software (bloatware), and have a clean taskbar and desktop.
Step 1: Download Windows 10 ISO
First, we need a copy of the Microsoft Windows 10 operating System.
1)	Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10 and grab the media creation tool.
